    "1. create a process that will discriminate computer code and identify a language by the code features.\n",
    "2. the input training and test files needs to be prepared (presumed structure is a set of tuples [key feature, [set of features]).\n",
    "3. the discriminating features of code are not yet defined. \n",
    "4. the files need to be processed for input.\n",

    "1. Envisioning a set of data that includes a row number, a profile of regex distributions, and the code type. \n",
    "2. Need to determine how to read in a file name, capture the file extension and associate it with the regex text profile.\n",
    "3. Immerse self in the TextBlob software. \n",
